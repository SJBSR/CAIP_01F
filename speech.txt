I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.
I must say to my people, who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice:
In the process of gaining our rightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. 
Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. 
We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. 
We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. 
Again and again, we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force.
The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our 
white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. 
And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom.
We cannot walk alone.
And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead.
We cannot turn back.
There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, "When will you be satisfied?" 
We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality. 
We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways 
and the hotels of the cities. **We cannot be satisfied as long as the negro's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one. 
I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. 
Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. And some of you have come from areas where your quest -- quest for freedom 
left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. 
You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive. 
I have a dream
I have a dream
I have a dream
I have a dream
I have a dream
I have a dream
I have a dream
I have a dream
I have a dream
This is our hope, and this is the faith that I go back to the South with.
Let freedom ring
And if America is to be a great nation, this must become true.
Let freedom ring
Let freedom ring
Let freedom ring
Let freedom ring
Let freedom ring
But not only that:
Let freedom ring
Let freedom ring
Let freedom ring
Let freedom ring
And when this happens, and when we allow freedom ring, Free at last! Free at last!
Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!
